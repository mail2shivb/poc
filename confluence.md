# 🏛️ Corporate Takeover & Defence Tool

## 📘 Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

The **Corporate Takeover and Defence Tool (CTD Tool)** supports M&A analysts and corporate strategy teams to track, simulate, and defend against takeover attempts.
It combines data-driven analytics, regulatory insights, and defensive strategy modules in one platform.

### 1.2 Business Objectives

* Provide real-time monitoring of takeover activity
* Support regulatory, legal, and compliance reviews
* Enable scenario-based simulation for defensive tactics

### 1.3 Key Features

* Target company analytics (financials, ownership, sentiment)
* Defence strategy simulation (white knight, poison pill, etc.)
* Regulatory screening and deal risk scoring
* Shareholder mapping and influence analysis
