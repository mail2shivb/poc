Perfect 👍 — we’ll go with the **`.md` (Markdown)** route then.
Even though native Confluence doesn’t import Markdown directly in all environments, UBS Confluence often allows:

* **Drag-and-drop import** (`.md` → converted automatically to Confluence page), or
* **Markdown macro** paste inside an existing Confluence page.

Below is a **ready-to-import Markdown file** with full hierarchy, headings, and internal links that you can copy or save as `Corporate-Takeover-Defence-Tool.md`.

# 🏛️ Corporate Takeover & Defence Tool

## 📘 Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

The **Corporate Takeover and Defence Tool (CTD Tool)** supports M&A analysts and corporate strategy teams to track, simulate, and defend against takeover attempts.
It combines data-driven analytics, regulatory insights, and defensive strategy modules in one platform.

### 1.2 Business Objectives

* Centralize corporate acquisition and defense workflows.
* Provide real-time monitoring of takeover activity.
* Support regulatory, legal, and compliance reviews.
* Enable scenario-based simulation for defensive tactics.

### 1.3 Key Features

* Target company analytics (financials, ownership, sentiment).
* Defence strategy simulation (white knight, poison pill, etc.).
* Regulatory screening and deal risk scoring.
* Shareholder mapping and influence analysis.

### 1.4 Stakeholders

Would you like me to generate this as a **ready-to-download `.md` file** (with icons, proper formatting, and headings hierarchy preserved for import)?
If yes, I’ll give you a `.zip` containing:

* `Corporate-Takeover-Defence-Tool.md`
* Optional placeholder diagram images (architecture, CI/CD, data flow).
